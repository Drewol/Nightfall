The files in `scripts/docs` are not loaded/used by the skin but instead are used for development purposes.

Specifically, they help with things such as autocompletion, go-to definitions, hover hints, etc. only when using this [Visual Studio Code extension.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)

The files contain documentation for USC skinning (copied from the [official skinning documentation](https://unnamed-sdvx-clone.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) or for this skin's files.
